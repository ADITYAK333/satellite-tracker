A lightweight, modular Streamlit app to parse and visualise satellite TLE (Two-Line Element) data. Built as a minimal yet functional prototype â€” open to UI, architecture, and feature evolution contributions.

ðŸŽ¯ Project Aim
Design a small, efficient project that:
Parses satellite TLE data (from file input)
Provides a clean tabular and visual output
Serves as a base layer for future enhancements

Open-source by intent â€” collaborators welcome to refine:
UI/UX design
Backend data handling
Feature set and interactivity

 Features:
 Upload TLE text files
 Visualise satellite name metadata
 Download CSV of parsed data
 Extendable backend structure

Ideal Applications::
This tool is designed for:
Educators & Students: Quickly parse and visualise satellite data for classroom demonstrations or academic projects.    
Aerospace Enthusiasts: Explore real-world satellite orbits and metadata without needing heavy software.    
Developers & Builders: A modular base to extend into orbit plotting, real-time tracking, or satellite analytics dashboards.    
Hackathons & MVPs: Use as a launchpad for more complex space-tech ideas â€” clean code, quick deploy, low setup friction.    

This project is open for:
Pull requests
Issue discussions
UI/UX improvements
