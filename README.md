 Unified Space Explorer
A real-time dashboard to visualize satellite and planetary data using  
CelesTrak,  Skyfield, and  Le Systeme Solaire API.

 Core Features

 Satellite Tracker
- Live position of up to 10000+ satellites
- Real-time lat/lon/altitude
- Interactive globe (Plotly)
- Instant details 

 Planetary Explorer
- Data on planets, moons, dwarf planets
- Mass, gravity, radius, orbit period (in yr/mo)
- Real-time Earth-to-planet distance
- Wikipedia summaries + flashcard view

 Performance
- Threaded TLE fetch (faster load)
- Satellite limit control (via UI)
- Lazy loading for Wikipedia & heavy ops

 Built With
- Streamlit – Frontend framework
- Skyfield – Real-time ephemeris + orbits
- CelesTrak – Satellite TLE data
- Le Systeme Solaire API – Planetary info
- Plotly – Map visualizations
- BeautifulSoup + Wikipedia – Body summaries
  
Ideal Applications:    
This tool is designed for:    
Educators & Students: Quickly parse and visualise satellite data for classroom demonstrations or academic projects.    
Aerospace Enthusiasts: Explore real-world satellite orbits and metadata without needing heavy software.    
Developers & Builders: A modular base to extend into orbit plotting, real-time tracking, or satellite analytics dashboards.    
Hackathons & MVPs: Use as a launchpad for more complex space-tech ideas — clean code, quick deploy, low setup friction.
